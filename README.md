# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developers of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. 
Therefore the purpose of the project is to complete the already stated testing and complete it using Jasmine library.
